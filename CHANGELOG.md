# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to this plugin. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## v1.17.3 — Tighter subtask spacing

- Reduce vertical padding within subtask groups while preserving spacing between main tasks.

## v1.17.2 — Day sections in Bientôt

- Group Bientôt by Demain and weekday names, showing only days with tasks.
- Keep subtasks with their parent and remove repeated row dates while retaining due times.

## v1.17.1 — Equal-width tabs

- Rename Prochainement to Bientôt, retaining the next-six-days filter.
- Give all three tabs equal widths, including when the layout wraps on narrow panels.

## v1.17 — Focused task views

- Align subtask checkboxes with their parent’s text column, including deeper nesting.

- Replace Inbox with Sans date across every project and remove the Tout tab.
- Replace Demain with Prochainement: tomorrow through six days from today, including each main task's full subtree.
- Keep individual due dates visible and adapt tab layout to fit the longer label.
- Migrate the saved Tomorrow view to Upcoming. `d` opens it; Ctrl+d still schedules a task for tomorrow.

## v1.16.2 — Compact subtasks

- Remove repeated parent titles from subtask rows; indentation conveys the hierarchy.
- Reduce padding and gaps within each task tree while preserving separation between main tasks.

## v1.16.1 — Keep subtasks with their parent

- Show each main task followed by its entire nested subtree, including undated subtasks.
- Use the main task's date group and view membership for all descendants; retain individual subtask due labels and task IDs.
- Make counts match the displayed trees and remove cached descendants with a completed parent.

## v1.16 — Subtasks

- Display and count active subtasks in every matching view, grouped by their own due dates.
- Indent subtasks and show parent titles from the full snapshot, including parents outside the current view.
- Keep all existing keyboard and task actions available on subtasks.

## v1.15.2 — Date groups and readable secondary text

- Group tasks under En retard, Aujourd’hui, À venir, and Sans date; use Demain in the Tomorrow view.
- Keep keyboard navigation on tasks, with headings outside the selectable model.
- Omit redundant today/tomorrow date labels while preserving due times.
- Improve due-date, placeholder, settings-description, and status-text contrast using the theme foreground.

## v1.15.1 — Task shortcuts

- Enter and `e` edit the selected task; Enter in the editor saves it.
- `o` opens the selected task's Todoist page. Always launch its URL instead of only focusing an existing Todoist window.
- Space still completes tasks; Enter no longer emits the completion signal.

## v1.15 — Reliable task synchronization

- Fetch every page and derive views and counts from a shared snapshot.
- Serialize task actions, keep edits tied to task IDs, and wait for completion confirmation before removing rows.
- Ignore obsolete responses after account changes or mutations and preserve action errors through refreshes.
- Use one polling timer: 2 minutes open, 20 minutes closed.
- Store settings with private permissions from creation and atomic replacement; report persistence failures.
- Recognize French times and explicit no-date quick-add phrases; preserve newer quick-add drafts.
- Add regression tests, real QML parsing in CI, and updated security/dependency documentation.

## v1.14 — Native panel styling

### Added

- **Settings → Bar Count**: show a task count next to the bar icon — choose Hide (default), Today, Inbox, or All. Independent of whichever tab the popup itself is on, so it stays put even while you browse other views.
- The header subtitle now cycles through a small rotating list of phrases ("Counting boxes", "Chasing deadlines", …) with a soft fade, the same "trail of fading text" treatment the built-in Wi-Fi panel uses for its own connection status line.

### Changed

- The bar icon is now a hand-drawn Todoist checklist mark instead of a plain "✓" glyph — colored from the active theme (like the built-in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/Display icons), not Todoist's fixed brand red.
- The panel header's single status line is now a small stats grid (Tasks / Overdue / View / Synced), the same visual pattern the built-in Wi-Fi panel uses for its Ping/Packet Loss/IP/Gateway readout — including that panel's fuller spacing and right-aligned values, not just its label/value pairing. Overdue now turns the theme's urgent color when non-zero.
- The header icon is bigger, matching the Wi-Fi panel's own header icon size.
- The Today/Inbox/All tabs now use the shell's shared segmented-control component instead of a hand-rolled button row — same keyboard behavior as before (`Tab`/`Shift+Tab`/`t`/`i`/`a` still cycle views the same way), just native chrome.

## v1.13 — Token no longer exposed via the process list

### Security

- The Todoist API token was passed to `curl` as a literal `-H "Authorization: Bearer …"` argument, which made it visible to any local user via `ps`/`/proc/<pid>/cmdline` for the brief window each request was in flight. The token is now handed to `curl` over its own stdin (`-K -`, curl's documented pattern for this exact problem) instead of argv, so it never appears in the process list. Nothing else about the token's storage or handling changes — it's still only ever sent to `api.todoist.com` and stored `chmod 600` on disk. Reported in [omarchy-plugin-marketplace#430](https://github.com/HANCORE-linux/omarchy-plugin-marketplace/issues/430).

## v1.12 — Smarter Refresh

### Changed

- The list now refreshes immediately after you add, complete, edit, or delete a task, not just on a timer.
- Polling is now 2 minutes while the popup's open, 20 minutes in the background while it's closed (previously 5 and 15, and the two could overlap).

### Fixed

- A task whose completion actually failed (bad network, etc.) could still silently disappear from the list a moment later, as if it had succeeded. It now correctly stays put and shows the error.

## v1.11 — Overdue/Today split

### Added

- The Today view now splits into separate **Overdue** and **Today** sections instead of one combined list.

### Changed

- The empty-list message now reads differently per view ("Inbox is empty.", "No tasks yet.", "No tasks match this filter.") instead of always saying "Nothing due."

## v1.10 — Keyboard-navigable Settings

### Added

- Settings is now fully operable without a mouse — `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` and the arrow keys walk every control in order.
- `t` inside Settings opens Todoist in your browser.

### Fixed

- `Escape` now actually backs out of the token and filter fields.
- The **General** and **Advanced** Settings sections no longer overflow/truncate their button labels.

## v1.9 – v1.9.3 — Priority colors, popup spacing

### Added

- Tasks are now color-coded by Todoist priority (p1 red, p2 yellow, p3 blue, p4 default).

### Fixed

- The bar pill now holds a fixed width regardless of task count, so the popup's anchor point doesn't shift as the count's digit-length changes.
- More breathing room around the popup's edges — the quick-add field and view tabs no longer feel cramped against the border.

## v1.8 — Fixed popup size

### Added

- **Settings → Advanced**: adjustable popup width/height, persisted.

### Fixed

- The popup no longer resizes itself around the current task list — it's a fixed size now, and content that doesn't fit scrolls instead.

## v1.7 — Settings reorganized

### Added

- Settings reorganized into clearly labeled sections: **Account**, **Default filter**, **Keyboard shortcut**, **General**.
- **Refresh now** and **Keyboard shortcuts** buttons in Settings, with real "Refreshing…" feedback.

### Fixed

- The `?` shortcuts overlay no longer runs text past its border.
- Removed the bare header refresh/help icons, which gave no feedback when clicked — same actions are still available via Settings or their shortcuts.

## v1.6 – v1.6.1 — Overflow fix, shortcuts help

### Added

- `?` toggles a keyboard-shortcuts cheat-sheet overlay.

### Changed

- Dropped the spinning-icon animation on the Add button while a task is being created.

### Fixed

- The All view no longer bleeds content past the popup's rounded border with a long task list.
- `Enter` on a task now closes the panel after opening it in the browser, instead of leaving it open.

## v1.5 — Single-key view switching

### Added

- `t`/`i`/`a` jump straight to the Today/Inbox/All view; `p` toggles Settings.

### Fixed

- `Escape` while the Add-a-task box has focus now correctly just leaves the box, instead of doing nothing.

## v1.4 — Task actions

### Added

- Completing a task now strikes it through and dims it briefly before it disappears, instead of vanishing instantly.
- `Enter` opens the selected task on the Todoist website; `Space` completes it.
- `e` edits the selected task's title in place.

## v1.3 — Quick Add parser, delete

### Added

- Quick-add now uses Todoist's own Quick Add parser — `p1`–`p4`, `#Project`, `@label`, and natural-language dates all work like typing into Todoist itself.
- `q` jumps into the quick-add box; `x` deletes the selected task (with confirmation).

### Fixed

- The quick-add box no longer steals keyboard focus on every open, which had been silently blocking the arrow/Tab/`r` shortcuts.

## v1.2 — Full keyboard control

### Added

- Full keyboard control of the task list: `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` cycles views, arrow keys/`j`/`k` move the selection, `Enter`/`Space` completes, `r` refreshes.
- Visual redesign — icon + title, active-view subtitle, segmented view tabs.

### Changed

- The popup now drops directly below its bar icon instead of centering on the whole bar.

## v1.1 — Initial release

### Added

- Today/Overdue, Inbox, and All quick-view tabs.
- Custom Todoist filter field.
- Optional global keyboard shortcut to toggle the panel, safely applied to `bindings.lua` (backed up, with automatic rollback on error).
