![Todoist for Omarchy — your Todoist tasks, one keystroke away in Omarchy's top bar](assets/hero-banner.jpg)

The bar shows how many tasks are due today or overdue; click it for a popup
with the full list, a checkbox to complete each task, and a box to quickly
add new ones — all without leaving the keyboard.

for the story behind this plugin — why it exists, the keyboard-first design
constraints, and a few things that didn't work the first time.

## Features

- Bar pill shows a theme-colored Todoist mark, matching the look of the
  built-in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth panels. Hover it for your current task count, or
  turn on **Settings → Bar Count** to show a live Today/Inbox/All count
  right on the icon.
- Panel lists matching tasks, sorted by due date then priority, color-coded
  by Todoist priority (**p1 red, p2 yellow, p3 blue, p4 normal**). The Today
  view splits into **Overdue** and **Today** sections so you can tell at a
  glance what's actually late.
- Click the circle next to a task to mark it complete (updates instantly,
  syncs to Todoist in the background).
- Quick-add box uses Todoist's own Quick Add parser — `p1`–`p4` priority,
  `#Project`, `@label`, and natural-language due dates (`tomorrow at 5pm`,
  `next Monday`) all work exactly like typing into Todoist itself. A bare
  task with no date in it (`Buy milk`) defaults to due **today**.
- **Today / Tomorrow / Inbox / All** quick-view tabs above the list, plus a custom
  [Todoist filter](https://www.todoist.com/help/articles/introduction-to-filters-V98wIH)
  field in Settings for anything more specific (defaults to `today | overdue`).
- Settings view (gear icon) to paste your API token and manage the above.
- Optional global keyboard shortcut (**Ctrl+Super+Y** by default, or record
  your own) to toggle the panel from anywhere — no mouse required.
- Refreshes immediately whenever you open the popup, and whenever you add,
  complete, edit, or delete a task — not just on a timer. Otherwise polls
  every 2 minutes while the popup's open, or every 20 minutes in the
  background while it's closed (never both at once). Overlapping refresh
  requests are coalesced into one, so nothing fires twice.
- Matches whatever Omarchy theme you're running — the panel pulls its
  colors from the shell's own theme system, so it looks native under light,
  dark, or any custom accent color, with no separate config to keep in sync.

## Install

```
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/aryan-techie/omarchy-todoist.git --enable
```

Add the bar icon (skip this if `--enable` already placed it):

```
omarchy bar put omarchy-todoist --section right
```

## Setup

1. Open the panel (click the bar icon) — with no token saved it opens
   straight to Settings.
2. In Todoist, go to **Settings → Integrations → Developer** and copy your
   personal API token.
3. Paste it into the field and click **Save token**.

That's it — the panel switches to your task list and the bar icon lights up.

The panel drops right below its bar icon (not centered on the bar), at a
fixed size you control — see **Settings → Advanced** below. Content that
doesn't fit scrolls inside the panel instead of resizing it. The bar icon
itself is a fixed-size slot regardless of task count, so the panel's anchor
point never shifts as your count changes.

## Usage

- **Open/close**: click the bar icon, your keyboard shortcut (see below), or
  `omarchy-shell shell toggle omarchy-todoist`.
- Click **Today**, **Inbox**, or **All** to switch views.
- Click a task's circle to mark it complete.
- Type in the box at the top of the list and press Enter (or click **Add**)
  to create a task — see Quick Add syntax above (`p1`, `#Project`, dates).
- The gear icon (or `p`) opens Settings, organized into **Account**,
  **Default filter**, **Keyboard shortcut**, **General** (Refresh now,
  Keyboard shortcuts), and **Advanced** (popup size) sections.
- Middle-click the bar icon to refresh without opening the panel, or press
  `r` while the panel's open.

### Keyboard controls

The whole panel is operable without a mouse:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Escape` | Back out of Settings to the task list (works from any Settings field too); press again to close the panel. While the Add-a-task box has focus, just leaves the box instead |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Cycle Today → Tomorrow → Inbox → All. Inside Settings, instead walks every control in order — token field, Save/Remove token, filter field + Apply, keybind buttons, and the General/Advanced buttons and steppers — scrolling as needed to keep the focused control in view |
| `a` / `d` / `i` / `t` | Jump straight to the Today, Tomorrow, Inbox, or All view. When a task is selected, `a` sets its due date to today, `d` to tomorrow, and `i` removes its due date. Inside Settings, `t` opens Todoist in the browser instead |
| `q` | Focus the Add-a-task field |
| `p` | Toggle Settings open/closed |
| `↑`/`↓` or `k`/`j` | Move the selection up/down the task list |
| `Enter` | Open the selected task on the Todoist website, then close the panel |
| `Space` | Complete the selected task |
| `e` | Edit the selected task's title in place |
| `x` | Delete the selected task (asks for confirmation first) |
| `q` | Jump into the Add-a-task box |
| `r` | Refresh |
| `?` | Toggle a shortcuts cheat-sheet overlay (also a button in Settings) |

Completing a task strikes it through and dims it for a moment before it
disappears from the list, so the click reads as "done" rather than "vanished."

Typing in the token, filter, or quick-add fields (or recording a shortcut)
temporarily suspends these so normal typing works. `x` for delete matches
this shell's own convention (see `Ui/PanelKeyCatcher.qml`) rather than the
physical Delete key, which has no printable character for a panel's key
handler to see.

### Keyboard shortcut

In Settings, click **Ctrl+Super+Y** to use that shortcut, or **Record
custom…** to press your own combo (any number of Super/Ctrl/Alt/Shift plus
one key). Applying it edits `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua` — the file is
backed up first, Hyprland is reloaded, and if the reload reports any config
error the backup is restored automatically. **Remove** takes the line back
out the same safe way. No shortcut is set until you explicitly choose one
here; the plugin never touches your Hyprland config on its own.

Note: pressing the shortcut again while the panel is open closes it — that's
the built-in way to close the panel from the keyboard. Your existing
"close window" keybind is untouched and still closes whatever app window is
focused, not this panel (that's a Hyprland layer-shell limitation shared by
every panel in the shell, not something specific to Todoist).

## External dependencies and system-level modifications

This plugin runs `curl`, `mkdir`, `chmod`, `bash`, `awk`, `cp`, `xdg-open`
(only when you press Enter on a task, to open it in your browser), and
(only for the optional keyboard shortcut) `hyprctl` via Quickshell's
`Process` — all standard on any Omarchy install, no extra packages required.
`curl` is the only thing that talks to the network; every request goes
straight to `https://api.todoist.com/api/v1/` with your token in an
`Authorization: Bearer` header. Nothing else is contacted, and nothing runs
with elevated
privileges.

**The only system file this plugin can modify is
`~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua`, and only if you set a keyboard shortcut from
Settings.** `set-keybind.sh` then:

1. Backs up `bindings.lua` to `bindings.lua.bak.<unix-timestamp>` (not
   auto-deleted — clean these up yourself periodically if you change the
   shortcut often).
2. Adds or rewrites the one `o.bind(...)` line that toggles Todoist,
   identified by matching the exact `omarchy-shell shell toggle
   omarchy-todoist` command string — no other line is ever
   touched.
3. Runs `hyprctl reload` and checks `hyprctl configerrors`.
4. If the reload reports any config error, restores the backup and reloads
   again — a bad shortcut can't leave Hyprland in a broken state.

This never happens automatically — only when you click **Ctrl+Super+Y**,
**Record custom…** + **Apply**, or **Remove** in Settings. Adding/removing
the bar icon itself only touches your own `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json` bar
layout, the same as any other bar widget you add or remove through
`omarchy bar`.

## State files

- `~/.local/state/omarchy/omarchy-todoist/settings.json` —
  your Todoist API token, filter, quick-view, keyboard shortcut, and popup
  size. Created
  on first save; the file is `chmod 600`'d right after writing since it holds
  a secret. Delete it (or use **Remove token** in Settings) to disconnect the
  plugin from your account.
- `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua.bak.<timestamp>` — backups from every
  keyboard-shortcut change (see above). Safe to delete once you're happy with
  your shortcut.

## Uninstalling

`omarchy plugin remove omarchy-todoist` removes the plugin
files but does **not** touch the two locations above — if you set a keyboard
shortcut, remove it from Settings first (or delete the matching `o.bind`
line from `bindings.lua` yourself), and delete the state directory if you
want your token gone too.

## Todoist API

Uses the [Todoist API v1](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1/):
`GET /tasks/filter` (or plain `GET /tasks` for the All view), `POST
/tasks/quick` (Quick Add, natural-language parsing) for new tasks, `POST
/tasks/{id}` to edit a task's title, `POST /tasks/{id}/close` to complete,
`DELETE /tasks/{id}` to delete. `Enter` opens
`https://app.todoist.com/app/task/{id}` in your default browser. The older
REST API v2 was retired by Todoist in February 2026, so this plugin only
supports the current API.
